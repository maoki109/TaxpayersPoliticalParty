# Taxpayers Political Party
DPhi Machine Learning Bootcamp Datathon 1 

## Objective 
Build a machine learning model that would predict the political party to which a taxpayer belongs to. 

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about US taxpayers. There are 10 independent columns and 1 dependent column. This dataset includes attributes like household income, household debt level, if the taxpayer is married or not, how many cars their household has, if they filed their taxes in the last three years or not. 

## Model Building
We perform some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given dataset and try building a model using a Logistic Regression Model and Random Forest. Boruta feature selection was attempted but was not useful. Final model uses a Random Forest Classifier.
